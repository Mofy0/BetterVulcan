<h1>BetterVulcan</h1>

<h4><b>What is the Purpose of the Application?</b></h4>

The purpose of the application is to create a “Better ” Vulcan, which is currently in a really bad situation.

<h4><b>How does it work?</b></h4>

The site is done mostly with php, so it relies on the fact that it connects to a database where it downloads information to the client and then displays it. 
In this case it is the student's grades. 

<h4><b>What user interaction is all about?</b></h4>

User interaction involves adding or deleting grades that are assigned to a student in a teacher account or, deleting or adding administrator, student and teacher accounts. 
Also from the student's account you will be able to see the grades of his subjects and in the future maybe the timetable.
